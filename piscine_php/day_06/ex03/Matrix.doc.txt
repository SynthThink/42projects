<- Matrix ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Matrix class defines 4x4 Matrix that defines different types of transformation.

A matrix is defined either by a set of PRESETS or a custom array of 4 x 4 ints.
Following presets are available:
IDENTITY, SCALE, RX, RY, RZ, TRANSLATION and PROJECTION.
$matrix = new Matrix( array( 'preset' => Matrix::IDENTITY ) );
Depending on the preset there are additional required arguments:
SCALE : 'scale' argument as an int
RX RY RZ : 'angle' argument as int which represents degrees of angle
TRANSLATION : 'vtc' argument which is an instance of Vertex class
PROJECTION : 'fov' in degrees, 'ratio' as float, 'near' as int, 'far' as int.

Any other use is undefined behaviour.

All attributes are private and cannot be accessed directly.

The class provides the following methods standard methods:
- public function mult () : Return a new matrix which is the dot product of the two matrix.
- public function transformVertex () : Return a new Vertex which has been transformed by the matrix.
doc : print this documentation.
__toString to print Matrix characteristics

verbose static attribute is available for more information during construction and deconstruction of Matrix.
